Tasks for today-

1. Create a student class. Add the necessary data members and also add a dynamic array to store the marks of 5 subjects (use new keyword). Initialize the data members using constructors. We don't know the cgpa yet so assign it some random value in constructor. Write following functions inside the class -
    Function to return the total marks. Function to calculate and store the cgpa in the variable, Funtion to take input (Dont take cgpa as input) and to display the data.

Think : Where can you use delete keyword to free the memory allocated to the marks array.

2. Overload the showRank function in the following way -
    When the function has only int as an argument, print that integer as rank.
    When the function has only student as an argument, print the student details and print "no rank".
    When the function received one student and one int as arguments, print the student details and the rank.
    Rank is not a data member of Student

Remember : Avoid copy pasting the code. Define proper functions.
